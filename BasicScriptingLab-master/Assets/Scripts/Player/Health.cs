       just a name associated with a value. In this case "startingHealth" is set to 1. Following
       the variable is a comment that explains what it is used for. These public variables will
       show up in the inspector when you attach this script. If you are ever unsure how a variable
       is being used just ask! If opening scripts is daunting fear not, you will not be required 
       to ever look at a script ever again in this class, but we encourage you to experiment! */

            // The downside with this line is that many other scripts will have null pointers and throw errors once the player is destroyed (which is technically fine)
